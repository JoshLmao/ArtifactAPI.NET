Below is a quick setup guide on how to get started with the API. If you have any problems, refer to the [F.A.Q page]({{ '/pages/faq' | relative_url }})

# Quick Start with Artifact API .NET

1. Import ArtifactAPI.NET to you project, manually ~~or through NuGet~~ (WIP)
2. Instantiate the **ArtifactClient** class

```csharp
//Create the ArtifactClient
ArtifactClient client = new ArtifactClient();
```

Thats it. You can then access the client functions to get what you need. Check out the [ArtifactClient page]({{ '/pages/artifact_client' | relative_url }}) for all methods and information
